### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2nd year Electrical & Computer Engineering Major at Northeastern Univeristy in Boston, MA. 

Most of my current work is done as a **Firmware Project lead** in Northeastern Electric Racing (Northeastern-Electric-Racing/shepherd_bms). 

That project mostly consists of loe-level C++ to interact with hardware, along with some higher level C++ firmware
