### Shepherd BMS Firmware Project Lead
 <br />

 

Hey! I'm a 3rd year Electrical & Computer Engineering Major at Northeastern Univeristy in Boston, MA. 

Most of my current work is done as a **Firmware Project lead** in Northeastern Electric Racing:  
https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/ShepherdBMS-2 (current year)  
https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/shepherd_bms (last year's iteration)  
https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded-Base (custom driver code)  

This is a bare-metal C application that controls our cars' battery management system, and it includes driver development and app dev.
<br />
<br />


### Shepherd BMS Firmware Project Focus:

* Abstract CAN, SPI, I2C communication 
* Develop control code to ensure correct behavior from BMS, charger, motor controller, & other peripherals
* Recieve and process data from accumulator & other peripherals.

I'm also currently working on a project to help me learn Rust, which is a 2D, retro arcade style game. I'm still developing it and learning Rust, but feel free to check it out here:
