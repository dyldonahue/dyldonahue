  Hey! I'm currently completing my Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, MA
</p>


<br />

## Past Roles & Work:
### Head of Firmware, Northeastern Electric Racing
Our team develops industry-level RTOS and bare metal applications for vehicle controls, sensing, and telemetry systems, used across our electric formula-style car.
 <br />

🟦 [Shepherd BMS v2.0](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/ShepherdBMS-2)  
Our fully custom, bare metal C battery management system application

🟦 [Cerberus MPU](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Cerberus)  
RTOS vehicle control application

🟦 [Odysseus](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Odysseus)  
Our MQTT based telemetry system - powered by a custom linux distribution through buildroot

🟦 [Embedded-Base](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded-Base)  
driver-level & interface code used across various applications


🟦 [Shepherd BMS v1.0](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/shepherd_bms)  
This is our first iteration of Shepherd BMS, built in C++ for Arduino based systems

🟦 [NERduino](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/NERduino)  
Northeastern Electric Racing's custom Arduino - powering early generation vehicle controls

## Other Projects:

🟩 [Custom Load Address Predictor](https://github.com/dyldonahue/load-address-predictor)  
I developed a novel load address predictor and simulator based on the BERTI predictor and tested it on state-of-the-art prefetching benchmarks

🟩 [Hybrid GPU/CPU workload performance analysis ](https://github.com/dyldonahue/HPC/tree/main/final)  
This project, which included a written report, measured the performance of a few benchmark algorithms
when the workload was split (at various balances) between a p100 GPU and Xeon CPU. 

🟩 [Equivariant Robotic Manipulation Benchmark](https://github.com/dyldonahue/mimicgen_benchmark)  
This is a project I'm working on with Northeastern's Helping Hands lab to develop a reinforcement learning benchmark
that provides sample tasks with object poses utiliziing SO(3) space. This is built upon Robosuite and MimicGen

🟩 [ROS2 Learning](https://github.com/dyldonahue/ROS2-intro)</p>
A simple ROS2 simulation I used to help learn ROS2

🟩 [Arcade Game](https://github.com/dyldonahue/ArcadeGame)  
This is a project im working on as I learn Rust - it's a retro-style 2D game built with ggez
