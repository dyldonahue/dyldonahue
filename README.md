  Hey! I'm a Senior Electrical & Computer Engineering Major at Northeastern University in Boston, MA
</p>


<br />

## Here are a few of my active projects:

ðŸŸ¦ [Autunmous Drone Control]()
This is our autonomus implementation for a 3D sensor drone Capstone project

ðŸŸ¦ [Secondary Sensor Board Firmware](https://github.com/Big-Dawgs-Capstone/ssb-firmware)
This is a simple RTOS application to aggregate sensor data, process it, and pass it to a Jetson for the same Capstone project as above

## Past Roles & Work:
### Head of Firmware, Northeastern Electric Racing
Our team develops industry-level RTOS and bare metal applications for vehicle controls, sensing, and telemetry systems, used across our electric formula-style car.
 <br />
 

ðŸŸ¦ [Shepherd BMS v2.0](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/ShepherdBMS-2)  
Our fully custom, bare metal C battery management system application

ðŸŸ¦ [Cerberus MPU](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Cerberus)  
RTOS vehicle control application

ðŸŸ¦ [Odysseus](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Odysseus)  
Our MQTT based telemetry system - powered by a custom linux distribution through buildroot

ðŸŸ¦ [Embedded-Base](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded-Base)  
driver-level & interface code used across various applications


ðŸŸ¦ [Shepherd BMS v1.0](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/shepherd_bms)  
This is our first iteration of Shepherd BMS, built in C++ for Arduino based systems

ðŸŸ¦ [NERduino](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/NERduino)  
Northeastern Electric Racing's custom Arduino - powering early generation vehicle controls

## Other Projects:

ðŸŸ¦ [ROS2 Learning](https://github.com/dyldonahue/ROS2-intro)</p>
A simple ROS2 simulation I used to help learn ROS2

ðŸŸ¦ [Arcade Game](https://github.com/dyldonahue/ArcadeGame)  
This is a project im working on as I learn Rust - it's a retro-style 2D game built with ggez
