### Shepherd BMS Firmware Project Lead
 <br />

 

Hey! I'm a 2nd year Electrical & Computer Engineering Major at Northeastern Univeristy in Boston, MA. 

Most of my current work is done as a **Firmware Project lead** in Northeastern Electric Racing:
https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/shepherd_bms

That project mostly consists of low-level C++ to interact with hardware, along with some higher level C++ control software.
<br />
<br />


### Shepherd BMS Firmware Project Focus:

* Abstract CAN, SPI, I2C communication 
* Develop control code to ensure correct behavior from charger, motor controller, & other peripherals
* Recieve and process data from accumulator & other peripherals.
